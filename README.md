# the-signal

Fetch the track lists for the radio show The Signal.

The Signal aired for the last time this year and I really liked their track selection.
This python script crawls CBC's API to save the tracks that have aired on the show.
The API I use returns track back to somewhere in 2016. After that the data is unavailable.
